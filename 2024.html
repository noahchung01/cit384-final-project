                <h2>Spring 2024</h2>
                <p>T1 entered the LCK Spring Split determined to build on their past successes, showcasing strong macro gameplay and drafting flexibility.
                    However, despite their consistent performance, T1 struggled in high-pressure moments during the playoffs. 
                    Furthermore, the team faced unexpected challenges during the split, 
                    including targeted DDoS attacks that disrupted several matches, forcing reschedules and impacting their preparation and focus. 
                    This resulted in faltering coordination, alongside a conclusion of another domestic split without a title.

                <h2>MSI 2024</h2>
                <p>T1 entered MSI with high hopes but found that the issues from their Spring Split began to resurface on the international stage.
                    Their struggles with late-game decision-making and inconsistent coordination under pressure started to seep into their gameplay during the tournament. 
                    While T1 showcased flashes of brilliance in the group stages with strong early-game leads, they often faltered in closing out games against tougher opponents.
                    These recurring issues became more pronounced in the knockout stages, where they faced teams with stronger mid-to-late game strategies.
                    Against the LPL's top seed in the semifinals, T1’s inability to adapt to shifting dynamics within a series proved costly, resulting in a 1–3 loss. 
                    Their Spring performance's lingering weaknesses ultimately contributed to their elimination, raising questions about whether or not this roster will last the year.

                <h2>Summer 2024</h2>
                <p>The Summer Split presented T1 with a chance to recalibrate and address the inconsistencies that plagued their Spring and MSI performances.
                    However, their efforts to regain dominance were met with underwhelming results, as they continued to struggle against many of their rivals. 
                    Once again, T1 continued to struggle against Gen.G, once again failing to secure a victory in their long-standing rivalry.
                    Their lackluster results throughout the split left them in a precarious position, with their ticket to Worlds 2024 hanging by a thread.
                    In the end, T1 narrowly qualified as the LCK's fourth seed, a significant drop from their usual standing.

                <h2>Worlds 2024</h2>
                <p> Despite widespread doubts about T1's ability to compete at the highest level after a challenging domestic season, 
                    the team silenced critics with an impressive performance on the Worlds stage. 
                    Entering as the LCK's fourth seed, T1 embraced their underdog status and showcased their resilience and adaptability.
                    They dominated the group stages, demonstrating strong coordination and clutch decision-making in high-pressure moments.
                    In the knockout rounds, T1 delivered standout victories against formidable opponents, proving that their struggles earlier
                    in the year had only strengthened their resolve, resulting in them earning their second Worlds trophy together and a fifth trophy for the team,
                    defending their championship status from last year.
