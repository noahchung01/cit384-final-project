                <h2>Spring 2022</h2>
                <p> The first season of this roster, T1 began the year with unmatched dominance in the LCK, completing a flawless 18-0 regular season in the Spring Split. 
                    Despite many doubts regarding Zeus’s performance on the roster as a rookie in the league, he proved himself to be one of the strongest contenders, 
                    and the roster of Faker, Zeus, Oner, Gumayusi, and Keria showcased an exceptional blend of veteran leadership and youthful talent. 
                    They carried their momentum into the playoffs, sweeping their way to the LCK
                    Spring Championship and securing their place at the Mid-Season Invitational  as Korea’s top representative.

                <h2>MSI 2022</h2>
                <p> At MSI, SKT T1 were heavy favorites alongside China’s Royal Never Give Up (RNG). They demonstrated brilliance in the group stage and playoffs, 
                    but their dreams were crushed in a grueling 3-2 loss to RNG in the finals. Despite coming close, 
                    critical mistakes at pivotal moments denied them the title, leaving the team to reflect on the heartbreak of their first major international defeat of the year.
                    The defeat stung deeply, marking their first major international failure of the year. This loss only proved that even the presuming untouchable Gods of the year were still mortal.

                <p>
                    Determined to rebound from MSI, SKT T1 doubled down in the LCK Summer Split. 
                    Despite their remarkable performance throughout the regular season,
                    they once again fell short in the domestic playoffs, losing to Gen.G in a best of 5.

                <h2>Worlds 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    At Worlds, SKT T1 delivered an annihilating performance, excelling in the group stage and eliminating JD Gaming in the semifinals.
                    However, their campaign ended in heartbreak in the grand finals, where they fell 3-2 to underdog DRX in a close series.
                    Despite Faker’s leadership and the team’s resilience, critical errors cost them the championship, capping their Worlds run to a bitter end.
                    The defeat was devastating. Many speculated this roster to be one of the greatest to have come by,
                    yet with only one domestic title to their name, fans could only wonder if these players could stick together for another year.
