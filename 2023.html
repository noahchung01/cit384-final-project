                <h2>Spring 2023</h2>
                <p>Spring 2023: T1 delivered a dominant performance during the LCK Spring Split, 
                finishing the regular season with an impressive 17–1 record, securing the top seed heading into the playoffs.
                They swept through the semifinals, reinforcing their position as the favorites to claim the title. However, in the grand finals,
                T1 faltered in critical moments despite their regular-season success, and fell 1–3 resulting in ending the split as runners-up, 
                which left fans questioning their ability to close out on the biggest stage.

                <h2>MSI 2023</h2>
                <p>At MSI, T1 entered the tournament with high expectations, showcasing strong form in the early stages. 
                They advanced through the group stage and playoffs with confident victories, displaying their trademark synergy and mechanical skill. 
                However, T1 struggled to adapt to JDG, LPL's first seed, resulting in a narrow 2–3 loss, pushing them to the lower bracket.
                Their journey came to an end with a 1–3 loss to Bilibili Gaming, sparking speculation among fans that the roster’s future could be in 
                jeopardy without a championship to solidify their legacy.

                <h2>Summer 2023</h2>
                <p>The Summer Split was fraught with challenges for T1, most notably a wrist injury to Faker, 
                which derailed their momentum and contributed to a dismal 1–7 record during his absence. 
                Faker's return brought stability and improved coordination, allowing the team to recover and end the regular season with a 9–9 record. 
                In the playoffs, T1 showcased resilience, overcoming early setbacks to reach the finals once again. 
                However, they were once again taken down by Gen.G in a decisive 0-3, showcasing the slim chances of T1's chance at a Worlds victory this year.

                <h2>Worlds 2023</h2>
                <p>Entering the World Championship as the LCK's second seed, T1 demonstrated formidable prowess, advancing through the Swiss stage with a strong 3–1 record.
                    In the knockout phase, T1 stood as the last remaining LCK representative amidst a playoff bracket dominated by LPL teams, carrying the hopes of their region. 
                    They showcased dominance by defeating LNG Esports (3–0), the dominant JD Gaming (3–1), and Weibo Gaming (3–0) to secure their fourth World Championship title.
                    This victory proved to those around the world that T1 indeed has what it takes to win a major title, securing their fourth Worlds title seven years after their last.
